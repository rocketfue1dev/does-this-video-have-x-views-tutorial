# This Video Has X Views and Does This Video Have X Views?
Tom Scott and I made a similar video showcasing YouTube's API in a "This Video Has X Views" for Mr. Scott and "Does This Video Have X Views?" for myself. It didn't work for me as my video was uploaded to my brand account (https://bit.ly/RocketFue1) but it worked for Tom! (Tom Scott's channel: https://youtube.com/TomScott) Here's the code, built for Google Script, tutorial is in this README.md file.

# How?

In order to do this, you need to open a Google Script project. Open it up, paste the code in the code.txt file in there, change the IDTHING in the code to your video ID, run it (make sure you have the YouTube API enabled in the preferences) connect your channel (MUST BE A PERSONAL CHANNEL - NOT BRAND ACCOUNT), and there you go. Simple, isn't it!
